    <h1>Computer Programming</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
    <p><span>Computer programming</span> is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to
        accomplish a
        specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis,
        generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of
        algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a
        program
        is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is
        directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of
        instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system)
        on a
        computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several
        different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

    <hr>
    <p>Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer
        was
        invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book
        of
        Ingenious Devices.[4][5] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a
        musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and
        cams.[6][7]
        In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" – a series of
        pasteboard cards with holes punched in them. Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In
        the
        9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted
        code,
        in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by
        frequency analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.[8] The first computer program is generally dated
        to
        1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers,
        intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.[9] Data and instructions were once stored
        on
        external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks. In the 1880s Herman
        Hollerith
        invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[10] Later a control panel (plug board) added
        to
        his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record
        equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the
        first
        electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both
        programs
        and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.[11]
        Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine,
        often
        in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a
        text
        format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying
        addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine
        language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.
        High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less
        bound to
        the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[12] by Grace
        Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[13][14] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to
        have
        a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[15] and many other languages were soon developed—in
        particular,
        COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.
        These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and
        more
        capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target for varying machine instruction sets via
        compilation
        declarations and heuristics. Compilers harnessed the power of computers to make programming easier[15] by
        allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation.
        Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape. By the late 1960s, data storage
        devices
        and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the
        computers. Text editors were also developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily
        than with punched cards.

    <h2 id="quality">Quality requirements</h2>
    <p>Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The
        following properties are among the most important:</p>
    <ul id="quality-requirements">
        <li>Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of
            algorithms and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g.,
            buffer
            overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).</li>
        <li>Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations
            such
            as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory,
            operating
            system services, and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.</li>
        <li>Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its
            intended
            purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even
            regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical, and sometimes hardware
            elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user
            interface.</li>
        <li>Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a
            program can be compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities
            provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected
            behavior of
            the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform-specific compilers (and sometimes
            libraries)
            for the language of the source code.</li>
        <li>Maintainability: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in
            order
            to make improvements or to customize, fix bugs and security holes, or adapt it to new environments. Good
            practices[18] during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be
            directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long
            term.
        </li>
        <li>Efficiency/performance: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space,
            slow
            devices such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the
            better.
            This also includes careful management of resources, for example cleaning up temporary files and
            eliminating
            memory leaks. This is often discussed under the shadow of a chosen programming language. Although the
            language certainly affects performance, even slower languages, such as Python, can execute programs
            instantly from a human perspective. Speed, resource usage, and performance are important for programs
            that
            bottleneck the system, but efficient use of programmer time is also important and is related to cost:
            more
            hardware may be cheaper.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="readability">Readability of source code</h2>
    <p>In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose,
        control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability,
        usability and most importantly maintainability. Readability is important because programmers spend the
        majority
        of their time reading, trying to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new
        source
        code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study found that a few
        simple
        readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.</p>
    <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithmic complexity</h2>
    <p>The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with
        discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problems. For this purpose,
        algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use, such as
        execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with
        a
        variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose
        algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.</p>
    <h2 id="chess">Chess algorithms as an example</h2>
    <p>"Programming a Computer for Playing Chess" was a 1950 paper that evaluated a "minimax" algorithm that is part
        of
        the history of algorithmic complexity; a course on IBM's Deep Blue (chess computer) is part of the computer
        science curriculum at Stanford University.</p>
    <h1 id="prog-lang">Programming languages</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). The
        choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task,
        availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best
        suited
        for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who
        know
        the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which
        programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from "low-level" to
        "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas
        "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to
        code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones.</p>
